# SyncLink

(Work in progress) The purpose of this project it to create an app that searches for music rights information (i.e. writers, publishers, labels) from multiple sources and brings them together to create the "full picture" for that song. Utilizing the Musixmatch, Spotify, and Genius APIs, when a user searches for a song the results from each of these websites will be displayed. Additionally, I will scrape the What Song website which specifically looks at songs placed in Film/TV to predict the "clearability".
