# Sync Link

When researching music rights online, there are often lots of discrepancies. In my experience, one of the best ways to combat this is to check as many sources as possible. However,  this can be very time consuming (and frustrating). For this project, I wanted to create a better way to search. 

“Sync Link” aims to link multiple sources together to create a dashboard of master/publishing info and more! It utilizes APIs from Spotify, Genius, Deezer, and MusicBrainz in conjunction with web scraping additional sites to return two master sources, two publishing sources, lyrics, artwork, and embedded audio in one click. It also uses machine learning to predict the “clearability” of a song based on a dozen key features.
